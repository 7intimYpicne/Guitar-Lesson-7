# Guitar Lesson 7
 
 
Before we dive into playing, we'll start with some fundamental exercises for your picking and fretting hands to get you set up for success. Lastly, we'll work on coordinating your hands so you can play your first set of chords.
 
The typical guitar has six strings. In standard tuning, each string is tuned to a specific note, and we refer to that string by the note it plays when you pluck it without putting your hands on the fretboard. This is called an open-string note.

For more dexterity training, we have an article on finger exercises for beginner guitarists in our blog. Some may be too advanced for your very first guitar lesson, but others are great for absolute beginners.
 
When you are strumming open chords, you can either do an upstroke or a downstroke. A **downstroke**is the strumming motion when your hand moves across the strings in a downward motion towards the floor. The **upstroke** starts low and moves across the strings towards your chin.
 
When you strum, you want the main movement to come from your wrist. The rest of the arm should move to support the wrist movement when needed. Your arm should be relaxed and rest against the body of the guitar.
 
Play one bar of E minor, then change to one bar of A minor. One bar is equal to four beats. So you play four beats on each chord. Once you get comfortable playing the chords, add a third chord to the mix, then a fourth.
 
There really isn't a best age for kids to start guitar lessons, but most children under the age of 7 generally don't have the dexterity or patience needed to learn to play the guitar. With persistence and motivation some kids have learned to play guitar at some impressively young ages, but it really comes down to is the individual attitude and maturity level of the student.
 
The time it takes to learn the guitar can vary from 6 months to a few years. With steady practice, playing in a group, and weekly private guitar lessons, kids and adults can play with basic proficiency in as little as 6 months. Some students reach the level of advanced guitarists in as few as 3-5 years, but it does vary.

The bottom line is that it's not the songs you practice, but just that you or your kid spends time playing the guitar. To see the best results, our guitar teachers recommend that students spend at least 30 minutes practicing the guitar every day.
 
Exact prices depend on the program and vary between locations. What's included? Unlike most hourly guitar lessons, our programs include weekly private guitar lessons and group rehearsals that inspire confidence and teamwork. Guitar students are also welcome to use our facilities whenever we're open, even if they just want to hang out and learn from or collaborate with other musicians. Find your location.
 
While four years old is a little young for formal guitar lessons, it's not too early to begin teaching your child musical concepts that will be important once they are old enough for guitar instruction at School of Rock. Your 4-year-old can participate in the Little Wing music program to learn fundamental concepts through fun, dynamic musical activities.
 
Students are encouraged to purchase their own guitar, especially as they reach higher skill levels. School of Rock does occasionally let kids borrow electric guitars for rehearsal, but for best results students are encouraged to have a guitar and amp at home for daily practice.
 
There are many factors when it comes to determining which guitar is best for a child or beginner. You can learn more about how to decide the best beginner guitar for you and then check out our buying guide!
 
A practice amp should be just fine for most kids and adults taking guitar lessons with School of Rock. Our guitar instructors typically recommend a 2-channel amp with built-in distortion, so that students can play the guitar with a clean or distorted tone.
 
At School of Rock, we teach private guitar lessons in-person or online in conjunction with weekly band rehearsals meant to build confidence and teamwork. While we do offer private guitar instruction, we strongly encourage students to play in band rehearsals as a way of exploring group dynamics as they become more proficient on the guitar.
 
Our guitar instructors walk students step by step through how to play as part of a band. We encourage students to regularly practice, ask questions, and keep your guitar in tune. Our curriculum also teaches students how to read guitar tabs to ensure success both in and out of the classroom.
 
The internet has revolutionized learning. The guitar is no different. You'll make use of a **wide array of online guitar tools** at TheGuitarLesson.com, all helping you **learn to play as quickly and easily** as possible:

As a member of our music lessons family, you've been a part of a truly special community that is nurturing the next generation of musicians. At this time, our focus is on the health and safety of our instructors, students, and communities. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we have made the decision to temporarily suspend music lessons in all our stores and offer a temporary digital lessons program as a substitute, effective March 20.
 
Our technology presents an opportunity to keep the Guitar Center lessons program available to students who want to learn or improve their skills, digitally. While we understand that an in-person lesson is preferred, our instructors can utilize the Zoom teleconferencing platform to facilitate students' weekly music lessons experience.
 
The health and safety of our students, instructors and associates is our top priority. We want to assure you feel safe and comfortable at all times in our stores. We have worked diligently with our lessons parents and students to create safety standards ensuring our students and instructors stay safe during their lessons experience.
 
Given the CDC's updated guidance, in-store music lessons are now available in all **locations**. We are continuing to require all Lessons instructors and students to wear face coverings during their lessons. However, Guitar Center will no longer require fully vaccinated guests and associates to wear face coverings in our stores, except where it is required by local ordinances. Face coverings continue to be recommended for guests and our associates who are not yet fully vaccinated. We will continue our increased safety and cleaning measures, including social distancing, throughout our stores.
 
We will continue to offer one-on-one online music lessons with our instructors via the Zoom platform. Our technology presents an opportunity to keep the Guitar Center Lessons program available to students who want to learn or improve their skills from the comfort of home.
 
We have also reopened our Lessons lobbies, where parents and guardians with a Guitar Center Lessons Student Pass can wait for their student. In addition, parents and guardians can also watch their student's lesson remotely via Zoom. Ask your instructor for details.
 
Additionally, we are continuing to encourage students to bring their own instrument to their in-store lessons. However, students taking drums or keyboard/piano lessons can use the instruments in the lessons studios. Amplifiers and cables will also be provided for students taking lessons on electric guitar or bass. Drum students are encouraged to bring their own sticks.
 
New students only. Not to be used in conjunction with any other coupons, promotions or Lessons offers. No cash refunds. Lessons registration fee ($30 value) is required and not to be discounted with this offer. Offer valid at Lessons locations, online at guitarcenter.com, or by calling 866-761-0244.

Playing music is our passion. We have thousands of music instructors across the country who can help you cultivate your own identity and build the necessary skills to pursue your passion for a lifetime.
 
"My son has learned how to read music during his drum lessons. His instructor is patient, motivating and makes it fun. The lesson is a blend of current songs, technique training and music theory **geared to grow kids into lifetime musicians**."
 
"My son has loved taking guitar lessons at Guitar Center for the past three years. He has such a **knowledgeable and educated instructor** who has taught him not only to play songs, but also chords, modes, scales and theory. It has been a joy to see my son develop into such an engaged guitar player."
 
We offer live, one-on-one lessons on guitar (electric and acoustic), bass, drums, piano and DJ. At select locations, we offer lessons for orchestral stringed instruments and brass & woodwind instruments. We also offer singing lessons.
 
Each instructor customizes lessons to ensure you are learning what you like and having fun. Your instructor will start you slowly, introducing new concepts each week, plus give you exercises or easy songs to play to keep you learning at home.
 
Our flexible curriculum allows students of all skill levels to experience growth. We help create a foundational understanding of music theory through the style of music you want to play. Our instructors will work to understand your goals and passions, and make sure you are on the path to learning what you want at your own speed.
 
30-minute lessons allow young or beginner students to learn the basics of the instrument and start playing songs. 60-minute lessons are ideal for more advanced students looking to progress faster and focus on the finer points of technique.
 
Learning an instrument is an enriching and rewarding experience that creates lifelong benefits, including increased self-esteem and the boosting of memory. Additionally, benefits for school-age individuals can include improved coordination, the expanding of social skills, and higher scores in math, reading and language.
